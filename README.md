# bi-tempered-loss-pytorch
Pytorch implementation of Robust Bi-Tempered Logistic Loss Based on Bregman Divergences

This repository contains the direct translation from Tensorflow to Pytorch of the paper "Robust Bi-Tempered Logistic Loss
Based on Bregman Divergences" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03361). The repo translates the official Tensorflow repo which can be found here: https://github.com/google/bi-tempered-loss

To test the loss function with similar values to the test in the original repo, run the following file:

`python test_loss.py`
